AgraScan - Plant Disease Detection System

AgraScan is a deep learning-based web application that detects diseases in bell pepper, potato, and tomato leaves using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The system also suggests appropriate pesticides to mitigate the detected disease.

Features

üåø Plant Disease Detection: Upload an image of a plant leaf, and the model will classify the disease.

üî¨ CNN-Based Classification: Uses a deep learning model trained on a plant disease dataset.

üè∑ Pesticide Recommendation: Provides suitable pesticides based on the detected disease.

üåê Web-Based Interface: Deployed using Streamlit for ease of use.

üìä User-Friendly UI: Simple interface for farmers and researchers to diagnose plant health.
